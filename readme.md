Hello, this is a web3.0 application that runs on react for the front end.

The backend of this application is deployed on goerli testnet blockchain and the interactions are made through a smart contract written in solana.

You can create a campaign and other users can fund your campaign by visiting it. 
The amounts are currently in GETH for testing purposes, similar thing can be done on etherium blockchain.

Your collected amount is directly transfered to your metamask wallet as soon as the transaction is completed.

Every transaction occurs using metamask extension on the browser.
